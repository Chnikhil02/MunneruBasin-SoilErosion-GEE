# MunneruBasin-SoilErosion-GEE

## Objective

- Estimate annual soil loss (tonnes/hectare/year) for the Munneru Basin using satellite rainfall data and RUSLE factors.
- Analyze rainfall data from 6 satellite sources (01-01-2020 to 31-12-2020) to study its impact on soil erosion.
- Final soil loss rates informed soil conservation and management strategies.

## Note

The complete GEE scripts and detailed methodology are not shared publicly here.
